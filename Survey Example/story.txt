<span>O</span>ur company was founded in BC 757 during D-Day, when our city was surronded by friend-seem dogs that we could not know, damn bad dogs! The dogs were annoyed with their dog food that were marketed by cats. Cats did not care what their costumers says. However, our almighty employer, Himalayan Marmot, prevented this trouble with a simple solution, by feedbacking its clients and scratch the wise words out into to the minds with its little claws "If you want your business to grow, it’s critical that you keep your existing customers happy. To do so, you’ll need to measure and understand customer satisfaction". Long live Himalayan Marmot! Let us know how we can improve our products.
